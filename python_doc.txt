ImageCapturer.py

	def capture_images(inqueue,return_queue):
	''''Function which calles Facerecognizer and StillStarter. 

FaceRecognizer.py
	class FaceRecognizer:
	'''This lives in its own thread, and waits for input from inqueue. When an image is placed in inqueue,
		any faces in that image will be returned as subrectangles in outqueue.'''

		General use:

			-Instantiate with two queues, one for input one for output.
			-After initialization, call .start_thread
			-Will wait in its own thread for an image to be put in inqueue
			-When finished, will put the picture of just a face (if one is detected) in outqueue
			-Comment out line 'cv.ShowImage('face',cropped_image)' to stop image of face in gui

		Methods:

			__init__(self, inqueue, outqueue):
				Queue.Queue inqueue: used to pass images to the instance
				Queue.Queue outqueue: used to pass images back to the caller

			start_thread(self):
				Call this once per instance to set up the thread.

			analyse_picture(self):
				Do not call this method directly. It is called by start_thread and blocks
				until an image is placed in inqueue

StillStarter.py:
	class StillStarter
		-instantiate with the max number of processes allowed, your cv2 namespace, and a
			queue which will accept images from it.
